# About page

Hello,

I'm Gayathri Nandakumar. I'm from India. I moved to the US in 2017 and I live in the Pacific Northwest with my husband and 5 month old daughter. I am a full-stack developer at F5 Networks. My current work involves working with containers, Kubernetes, Helm charts, Golang and Ginkgo framework.

I've always wanted to have a portfolio website to streamline my learning process. The idea behind this website is to document whatever I learn, be it Gitlab, Kubernetes, Docker or Golang in the form of blogs or excerpts. I usually have a notebook and a pen when I learn something, as it helps me to structure my thought process. This blog series is an experiment to see how well I can document online.
