This is my first blog on a website hosted on Github pages with Jekyll. In Jekyll, blogging is powered by text files. No database! What I love about hosting a website on [Github pages with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) was that it was pretty easy to get started and I got the webpage up and running within a day. The [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) is well documented and you just need to know basic front-end stuff to get going. As a bonus, I liked how the tutorial enforces clean code and directory structure. Though Github pages has Jekyll integrated, I would recommend having Jekyll locally as it simplifies the development and testing process.

## Themes
Github pages has a list of [Jekyll themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) that serves as a preset for the structure and style of your webpage. Integrating the theme into your webpage is a [3-step process](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll) - Setting the theme for your repository, importing the themes's CSS and copying the theme's default layout.

## Troubleshooting
I did face a few errors while building Jekyll locally where a few components required by the build weren't present. During such errors, I just added the package to the Gemfile and it worked. Here is my Gemfile for reference. The `gem "github-pages"` was added to aid local development.

```
source "https://rubygems.org"

# gem "rails"
gem "jekyll"

gem "webrick", "~> 1.7"

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-sitemap'
  gem 'jekyll-feed'
  gem 'jekyll-seo-tag'
end

gem "github-pages"
```
