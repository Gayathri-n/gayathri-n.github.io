This is my first blog on a website hosted on Github pages with Jekyll. In Jekyll, blogging is powered by text files. No database!

Random text here on bananas. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains",
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.
